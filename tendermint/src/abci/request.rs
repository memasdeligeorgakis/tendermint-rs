//! ABCI requests and request data.
//!
//! The [`Request`] enum records all possible ABCI requests. Requests that
//! contain data are modeled as a separate struct, to avoid duplication of field
//! definitions.

// IMPORTANT NOTE ON DOCUMENTATION:
//
// The documentation for each request type is adapted from the ABCI Methods and
// Types spec document. However, the same logical request may appear three
// times, as a struct with the request data, as a Request variant, and as a
// CategoryRequest variant. Ideally, the documentation would be copied between
// these automatically, but doing this requires using #[doc = include_str!],
// which is unstable. For now, the Request enum is the source of truth; please
// change the docs there and copy as required.
